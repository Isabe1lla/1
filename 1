        <h3>Hailsham School</h3>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Hailsham is the boarding school where Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy grow up. It’s a seemingly idyllic place but with a dark undercurrent, designed to prepare them for their roles as organ donors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hailsham fosters creativity and encourages students to submit artwork for "The Gallery."</li>
            <li>Isolated from the outside world, creating both safety and foreboding.</li>
        </ul>
